This page is inspired by Derek Sivers' [/now](http://sivers.org/nowff) page movement.

I'm mostly sorting things out to move to Brno, Czech Republic in a few days. I'm spending more time with my family, saying goodbye to friends and looking for a flat in Brno. I'm also selling some things out, like my car and my guitar.

When I'm not doing that I'm working on:

* [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes): reading the source code and related material;
* [hashd](https://github.com/bertinatto/hashd): to get more C knowledge;
* [ohrad](https://github.com/bertinatto/ohrad): to get more Go Knowledge;
* this fresh-baked blog;
* learning Czech.
