This page is inspired by Derek Sivers' [/now](http://sivers.org/nowff) page movement.

I'm settling down in Brno, Czech Republic. New home, new job, new friends, new bank accounts, new taxes to pay; lots of new things to get used to.

When I'm not doing that, I'm:

* Home, chilling out with Camila.
* Understanding [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) code;
* Working on [hashd](https://github.com/bertinatto/hashd) to get more C knowledge;
* Working [ohrad](https://github.com/bertinatto/ohrad) to get more Go Knowledge;
* Working on this fresh-baked blog;
* learning Czech.
