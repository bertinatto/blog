&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-reading&#34;&gt;On reading&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to complete my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/5493-2017-reading-challenge&#34;&gt;2017 Reading Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and read 12 books this year. This was an improvement from last year, when I read only 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be quite frankly, I strategically picked a few small books so I could finish the challenge on time. I believe this is OK, but I would rather measure my reading habit by days I actually read something. Since it would be more difficult to track this approach, I am OK with the number of books for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, 2017 was the year that I got interested in fiction books. Non-fiction books are great to get new insights, but there is nothing more enjoyable that reading a good story in the early morning over a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-writing-software&#34;&gt;On writing software&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the software engineeting side, I broke some new grounds in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a little bit of Rust in the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the first edition of The Rust &lt;a href=&#34;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition&#34;&gt;Programming Language&lt;/a&gt; book and after a few days I manged to overcome the borrow checker and compile some small programs. Following that, I implemented a simple Pomodor timer that I called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bertinatto/prod&#34;&gt;prod&lt;/a&gt;. The highlight of the journey, though, was my implementation of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/redox-os/coreutils/commit/0a06679980e8b03d734a3ee5e3f5c2a785b081b6&#34;&gt;uniq&lt;/a&gt; command for the Redox OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got a bit more experience in Go. I developed a prototype for an NTP server called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bertinatto/ohrad&#34;&gt;ohrad&lt;/a&gt;. Also, I implemented a simple HTTTP daemon in my job. The highlight was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah/pull/336&#34;&gt;buildah PR&lt;/a&gt;. This one was very rewarding for me, specially because buildah is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.projectatomic.io/&#34;&gt;Atomic Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ugly duckling was C. In the hope to get more experience in this language I started a simple in-memory cache that I called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bertinatto/hashd&#34;&gt;hashd&lt;/a&gt;. I never really finished it, but I did learned a few new things on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-changing-jobs&#34;&gt;On changing jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 was the year that I left Scrapinghub and joined Red Hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Scrapinghub after 3 years I can&amp;rsquo;t even describe how much I evolved there. I was very happy to be joining Red Hat, but at the same time I was very sad to leave Scrapinghub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of getting my Czech Visa approved took around 6 months, but fortunatelly everything worked out well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-writing&#34;&gt;On writing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 I wrote many journal entries, but I failed to make it a habit. I found it a tedius task, but I confedd it&amp;rsquo;s pretty rewarding to read something I wrote a long time ago. It&amp;rsquo;s impressive to see how much I evolved and, at the same time, how I struggle with some recurring issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to blogging, I completely failed in 2017. I put down some random notes from different topics that later would become blog posts, but they never really reached to their  final destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-playing-the-guitar&#34;&gt;On playing the guitar&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to play the guitar but I had to leave it in Brazil. I made some progress and managed to play a few simple musics and fingerstyles. Nothing that someone would enjoy listening to, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-lifting&#34;&gt;On lifting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was deadlifting 140 kilos and squatting 136 kilos (not counting the bar) right before moving to Czech Republic. I had to stop lifting for a while until I settled down in Czech Republic, and my weights went down considerably. Hopefully I will get back to those numbers in 2018!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-traveling&#34;&gt;On traveling&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only long travel of 2017 happened when I moved from Brazil to Czech Republic. However, living in the middle of Europe brings great advantages! In 2017 I managed to visit 4 countries for the first time: Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;
